# Scripts

## Run Integration Tests locally

You can run local tests by specifying either a single spec file or an entire folder.

To run an entire folder, replace `FOLDER` with the desired one:

`npx cypress run './cypress/integration/FOLDER/**/*.cy.js'`

Example: `npx cypress run '.cypress/e2e/**/*cy.js'`

By default, the tests will run on `QA` environment. If you want to change that
you can specify the `environment=<qa/staging/production>`CLI argument

## Run local tests headed (Open mode)

`npm run start` - This command opens Cypress and allows you to select the browser
you want to run tests on and specify the spec file you want to run

## Run local tests headless

`npm run run` - This command will run all the `@exampleSanity` tagged tests and
run them in `Chrome` browser while register the run in Cypress Cloud dashboard.

`npm run test` - Same as above but this command won't do any Cypress Cloud registration.

To trigger runs on different environments, here are some examples you can follow:

`npm run test -- --env environment=qa` - Trigger headless run on `QA`

## Trigger Jenkins pipeline

To trigger a run on Jenkins, follow the next steps:
1. Go to *Jenkins URL*
2. Click on `Build with Parameters`
3. Specify the `branchName`, `environment`, `browser` and `nodeVersion` you want to use
4. Click on `Build`

Note: Currently, the only supported browser is `Chrome`

After the run is completed, you can find the HTML report attached to each run.
